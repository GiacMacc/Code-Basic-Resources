UL62109-1
Safety of Power Converters PV Power Systems

-Ingress protection/enclosure ratings:
Type 3R/IP34
Type 1/IP20

-Limits of voltage classes
Class A = AC sine: <_25RMS, AC nonsine:35.4 peak, DC: <_60 means
Class B = AC sine:50RMS, AC nonsine: 71 peak, DC: 120 mean
Class C = AC sine: >50RMS, AC nonsine: >71peak, DC: >120mean

-Impulse test voltage (impulse withstand for insulation between circuit directly/not connected to mains per overvoltage Cat. II:

System Voltage: 50V RMS (71 Vdc)<2000Vdc
Not connected to mains:
Basic/supplementary Insulation = 500V-8000V
Reinforced = 800V-12000V
Connected to mains:
Basic/supplementary Insulation = 800V-12000V
Reinforced = 1500V-16000V
