CenterPoint Energy (Southern Indiana Gas & Electric Company d/b/a CenterPointEnergy Indiana South (SIGE)) interconnection:

-Connection reqs in two docs:
VEC-007 = Transmission reqs 
VEC-006 = Interconnection guides for generation 
	Excess Distributed Generation rider (NEM for qualified customers)

-Frontier Utilities (Saver Plus 12) cheapest REP for Galveston

-CenterPoint Energy is 'pole and wires' utility (transmission owner), and do not sell electricity directly to end user but deliver electricity on behalf of REP

-CenterPoint Energy does not offer energy metering (NEM)*doesn't buy your excess

-Buy back program is with REP

Register and complete application through portal:

Application Materials:

-One-line diagram (breakers, inverter, panels, CenterPoint Energy meter)
-Layout diagram of site
-Make and model of approved inverters/solar panels (OEM)
-Installation inspection photos
-Interconnection study not typically required for residential systems <25kW AC (Steady state, short circuit, dynamics, etc.)
-Permit required if within city limits
-CenterPoint Energy visual inspection will not process until system passes city inspection
-Interconnection agreement sent to REP before operating
-Permission to Operate (PTO) granted
-Bidirectional meter programmed to track power consumed (kWh) and excess generated (kWg) within 24 hours
*values sent to retail electric provider (REP) and may take 3 billing cycles to reflect in energy bill
-Document Signing on email

-The AC disconnect switch should be a lockable external handle, visible disconnect switch installed within 10 feet of CenterPoint Energy's meter

After receiving study fees, CenterPoint will perform System Impact Study (2-4 mo.) and provide Construction Cost Estimate
Sing Interconnection Agreement with receipt of construction estimate payment to start construction (12-18 mo.)
Once site activity complete, customer schedules witness testing (4 weeks)
CenterPoint issues Permission to Operate Letter after successfully commissioning site

-Data needed for studies:
Max continuous AC output of generator or inverter
AC terminal voltage of generator of inverter
Positive sequence impedance of transformers and conductors
Continuous current ratings of transformers and conductors
Transformers tap settings (center-tapped, more taps)
Power factor at point of interconnections
Station service load for synchornou machines
Reactive capability of any power correction devices (capacitor banks)
Voltage control settings
Other data

-Components modeled for dynamics, transient stability:
Generator
Inverter
Exciter
Governor
Power system stabilizer
Compensator
Outer loop controller
Inverter controller
Under/over voltage and frequency relays
Station service loads
Power factor correction devices
Others

-Reliability concerns:
Locations of interconnected generation on EPS, if location is at transmission level then interruptions have greater impact
Generator size vs interconnected generator load + EPS line load

-Quality Concerns:
Lagging or leading power factor, capacitors may be used to correct lagging
Harmonic currents that occur at freq. other than 60Hz and can cause failure of protective relays, comms, and electronics
Voltage flicker with sudden changes of current flow in circuit
