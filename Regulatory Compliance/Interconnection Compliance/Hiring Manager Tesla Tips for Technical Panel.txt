UL-1973 - Batteries
ISO 15118 - EV to grid
IEC 61851 - Charging reqs for EV
^ from research

technical interview (charging technical or utility technical):

Utility:
understand arguments against IEEE1547
what would you do to help bridge the gap between Utility problems and DER problems (volt to var frequencies incorrect etc.)

charging: 
NAC (north American charging) standard
SAE J1772
SAE J3400
power share standard 
NEC 2023 article 625: supply equipment
UL9741 - (safety standard electrical export to grid)
UL2594 - electric vehicle supply equipment standards (superchargers)

UL free account to read customer documents (login) *digital view and create login

from interview

-Current Topics/project and bottlenecks
optimus robot UL standards?
EV charging bidirectionality to grid (only have to home)
Fire safety utility industry settles on good standards (want to see powerwall on fire)
9540B poor test for this b/c need component to catch fire
9540A for Ul9540 test for thermal propagation for wall mount to not catch on fire
UL 1741

-Flowdown of escalations during utility negotiations
tier 1 plan checker  (hardest to negotiate with)
building official or director (policy lead leads you are SME support)
city mayor (assistant)
Hawaii past experience permit phase delayed for 6m - 1y

-Most common issues in field
interconnection settings not set correctly
documentation largest escalation bucket or not understanding docs
triaging more efficient way
plan checkers no understanding reg interpretations
mainting database
power control systems ul1741 sb ul 3141 *still in works (utilities require testing to these standards) *NEM standards
EV side: metering (super charging network in other countries)
kiosk pricing and real time pricing
finding metering standards and compliance with FINRA
---------------------------------------------
JCA team 
projects vs escalations
grid codes inverter setting, dedicated grid code profiles for each utility
cat 3 default values for IEEE1547 for any utility
otherwise if utitlity deviates, must create new grid codes
process longer than it has to be, 2 months at a time,based on release date of code freezout date for next firmware version

breaking into new market and communication is not clear with major utilities for inverter reqs. (usually not done proactively, causing delays). processs gaps to bridge

day to day
addressing escalations
progressing on project initiatives:
foster PCS
project plan with stakeholder and documenting
evaluate success
addressing channel partners nationwide

interact with commercial, my role probably wont at first
EV side a lot of collaboration, but still more interconnection focus
what constitutes compliance with EV to home, what to provide as proof we are safe, still up in the air, interconnection standards not really built for it right now

lot of binational standards with Canada, this role more domestic, other countries take cues to for USA, hiring someone else for international
