DER and Storage Systems

Covers DER containing multiple DER units and equip. that provides electrical energy to loads within DER system and EPS. Standard evals impact on the risk of fire/shock.

-DER may be stand-alone or connected to EPS with islanding capability

-Area EPS interaction:
Inverters, converters, generators or storage or interconnection system equip. (ISE) complies with UL1741 SB

-Transition Modes:
DER must be able to transition between interactive and islanding mode and comply with IEEE2030.7
*DER without dispatch function are not required to balance generation and load prior to transition

-Power control systems comply to UL3141

-DER shall prevent backfeeding power to rotating generators through:
Reverse power relay 
Power control system per UL3141
Another method

-Disconnection means/deenergizing circuits shall open each ungrounded conductor of supply circuit. When handle of disconnecting means is operated vertically rather than rotationally/horizontally, up=on

-Steady-state conditions during tests happen when values are +_5% of measured value for 3 consecutive samples with interval between samples 1s<10s

-Steady Steate DER voltage RMS AC voltage is measure after any transient effects due to load application removal have ceased

-Voltage compliance is verified by measuring AC voltage with the DER supplying a resistive load under two conditions:
No load
Resistive load equal to lower of combined max continuous power rating for all DER nampeplate rating

-DER RMS voltage shall be 88%<110% of rated nominal. At end of test , a resistive load of 90% max continuous power rating shall eb applied and the system allowed to reach steady state. Load will be increased in increments of 5% until DER shuts down or load sheds

-Transient DER voltage compliance verified by measuring instant AC voltage at certain points after following step changes (IEEE1547) repeated 3 times:
Lower of combined mx cont. power rating for all DER/DER nameplate and no load(zero power)
Zero power to the lower of combined max cont. power rating

-Steady state frequency regulation range 56.5Hz<62Hz for AC stand-alone/islands DER

-For DER with inverters, compliance verified by measuring AC output frequency under following conditions under min. and max. rated DC input:
Inverter supplying no load
Inverter supplying resistive load equal to inverter's max continuous output power

-For DER employing electrical sources other than inverters, compliance verified by checking AC output frequency while supplying no load and a resistive load equal to max. continuous output power:
DER energy sources with inverters individually supplied with respective min/max input
Other DER sources with variable input individually supplied with respective min/max input

-DER system voltage distortion during grid forming mode:
Total RMS of harmonic voltages (excluding fundamental) shall not exceed 10% of fundamental RMS output voltage rating
RMS voltage in any single harmonic shall not exceed 6% of nominal fund. RMS output voltage rating
Sum of harmonics n=2 and n=40 shall be measured as percentage of fundamental frequency for total RMS measurement
*Measurements to be made with DER delivering 5% or the lowest continuous power available, 50% and 100% of its rating to a resistive load.
