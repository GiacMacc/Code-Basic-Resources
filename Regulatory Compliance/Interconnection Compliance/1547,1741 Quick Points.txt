IEEE 1547 
- Tech specs for interconnection and interoperabitlity for DER and utility
-Reqs for performance, Islanding, power quality (Voltage, Freq.)
- DER <10MVA
-Only for grid-tied DER
-Lockable break isolation device needed between Area EPS and DER
-Frequency droop
- Voltage range +-2% nominal
- Frequency range 58-61 Hz (when greater than 30% of nominal, DER trips)
- Enter service period default time 300 seconds for synchronism
- Withstand voltage and current surge per C37.90.1
- Continuous operation region (ride through) when voltage between 0.88 and 1.1 times the nominal Vn
- Reactive power injection capability 44% of nameplate apparent power kVA (absorption 25% of rated)
-Max DER response time to maintain constant power factor <10 seconds
- Impedance  between PoC and PCC is less than 0.5%
-2 second islanding req (trip and cease to energize during open phase condition)
breaker hold down kits convince jurisdictions
- Power factor mode typical mode for frequency/voltage ride through
