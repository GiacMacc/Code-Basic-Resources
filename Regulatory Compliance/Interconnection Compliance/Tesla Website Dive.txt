Tesla Master Plans

The Secret Tesla Motors Master Plan (just between you and me) (2006):

So, in short, the master plan is:

Build sports car
Use that money to build an affordable car
Use that money to build an even more affordable car
While doing above, also provide zero emission electric power generation options

Don't tell anyone.

-"Overarching purpose of Tesla Motors is to help expedite the move from a mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy towards a solar electric economy, which I believe to be the primary, but not exclusive, sustainable solution"

-Initial product = $89k Tesla Roadster (should beat Porsche or Ferrari in 'head to head showdown'), but long term plan was to make range of affordable family cars. Roadster also should be twice as efficient as Prius.

-Strategy is to enter at high end of market (with roadster sportscar) with customers paying premiums, and then drive down market as fast as possible

-Idea is that when someone buys Roadster, they are paying for R&D of low cost family car

-Repeated arguments against EV:
Battery Disposal
	Li-Ion batteries not classified as hazardous (landfill safe), are recyclable even with 100,000+ miles
Power Plant Emissions (long-tailpipe)
	Electric grid can be composed of renewables
	H-System Combined Cycle Generator from GE is 60% efficient in turning nat gas into electric with a 'Combined Cycle' where waste heat is used to create 	steam
	Roadster requires 0.4MJ/km, full cycle charge/discharge efficiency is 86% (for every 100MJ charge, 86MJ can be discharged)
	Roadster efficiency/range with power from nat gas is 1.14km/MJ
	Gas cards are 34.3 MJ/L - refinement/transport losses (18.3%) x MPG
	Prius at 55MPG with energy efficiency of 0.56km/MJ vs Toyota Camry with 0.28km/MJ

-Hybrid is a misnomer, they are really just gas cars with a little battery assistance with only slightly more efficiency

-"A world 100% full of Prius drivers is still 100% addicted to oil"

-Carbon Content Fossil fuels:
Natural Gas = 14.4g carbon/MJ
Oil = 19.9g carbon/MJ

Honda CNG (nat gas)               [14.4gC02/MJ content, 0.32km/MJ efficiency, 45.0g/km C02 emissions]
Honda FCX (nat gas-fuel cell)     [14.4gC02/MJ content, 0.35km/MJ efficiency, 41.1g/km C02 emissions]
Toyota Prius (Oil)                [19.9gC02/MJ content, 0.56km/MJ efficiency, 35.8g/km C02 emissions]
Tesla Roadster (nat gas-electric) [14.4gC02/MJ content, 1.14km/MJ efficiency, 12.6g/km C02 emissions]

-SolarCity solar panels to generate up to 50 miles/day of electricity
*you can be energy positive if you travel less than 350 miles/week

-------------------------------
Master Plan, Part Deux (2016):

So, in short, Master Plan, Part Deux is:

Create stunning solar roofs with seamlessly integrated battery storage
Expand the electric vehicle product line to address all major segments
Develop a self-driving capability that is 10X safer than manual via massive fleet learning
Enable your car to make money for you when you aren't using it

The first master plan that I wrote 10 years ago is now in the final stages of completion. It wasn't all that complicated and basically consisted of:

Create a low volume car, which would necessarily be expensive
Use that money to develop a medium volume car at a lower price
Use that money to create an affordable, high volume car
And...
Provide solar power. No kidding, this has literally been on our website for 10 years.

-Starting off with step one was necessary because it was all Elon could afford to do with what he made from Paypal
*thought chances of success were low, only wanted to risk his own funds

-As of 2016, only car companies to not go bankrupt are Ford and Tesla *starting a car company is idiotic, electric is idiotic ^2

-First master plan miss the point of attacks to tesla for making cars for rich people, but its main goal was achieved of explaining how Tesla would accelerate the advent of sustainable energy

-Key points in plan:
Integrate Energy Generation and Storage
	Solar roof, empowering individuals to be own utility (merge with SolarCity), Powerwall plus solar
Expand to Cover the Major Forms of Terrestrial Transport
	In 2016, Tesla was in 2 smaller markets (premium sedans & SUVs), Model 3 meant for most of the market
	Design a machine that makes the machine, factory is itself a product
	5-1x improvement is achievable by version 3 in ~2 year cycle, first Model 3 should be considered version 0.5 with 1.0 out in 2018
	Heavy duty trucks & high passenger-density urban transport (Tesla Semi) to unveil 2017
	Reducing size of buses, more seats, driver becomes fleet manager, matching accelerating and braking to other vehicles, accessible, summon button for 	people with no phones
Autonomy
	All Tesla vehicles with be fully self-driving (worldwide reg approval requires 6 billion miles), learning rate is at 3 million miles/day
	Autonomous driving can be safer than a person, therefore more moral to work on it now than delay release due to bad press 
	Once Autopilot is 10x safer than us vehicle average, beta label will be removed
Sharing
	Summoning Tesla from anywhere
	Add car to shared fleet, make money, lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

-Most cars are only used for 5-10% of the day
-------------------------------
Master Plan Part 3: Sustainable Energy for All of Earth (2023)

*Includes 'US fully electrified demand profile - part 1 & 2'
*Modeling done using data from Energy Information Administration (EIA) from 2019-2022
*Results for global economy estimates were scaled 6x for simplification

240 TWh Storage
30TW Renewable Power
$10T Manufacturing Investment
1/2 Energy Required
0.21% Land Area Required
10% 2022 World GDP
0 Insurmountable Resource Challenges

A fully electrified and sustainable economy is within reach through the actions in this paper:

1. Repower the Existing Grid with Renewables (36%)
2. Switch to Electric Vehicles (22%)
3. Switch to Heat Pumps in Residential, Business & Industry (23%)
4. Electrify High Temperature Heat Delivery and Hydrogen Production (13%)
5. Sustainably Fuel Planes & Boats (6%)
6. Manufacture the Sustainable Energy Economy
*Tesla currently working on first two steps

Modeling reveals that the electrified and sustainable future is technically feasible and requires less investment and less material 
extraction than continuing today’s unsustainable energy economy. 


Top Materials to Achieve Sustainable Energy Economy:
Lithium
Nickel
Silver
Zinc
Copper
Cobalt
Iron
Manganese
Aluminum
Graphite
Phosphorus

-Global primary energy supply is 165 PWh/year, with total fossil supply of 134 PWh/year. 37% (61PWh) is consumed before making it to customer, and 27% (44PWh) is lost through system inefficiencies. *Only 36% (59 PWh) is used to produce useful work or heat

-Applying the 6 steps would displace 125PWh/year of fossil fuels with 66PWh/year of sustainable electricity

-In the 2040’s, recycling will begin to meaningfully reduce primary material demand as batteries, solar panels and wind turbines reach end-of-life and valuable materials are recycled. Although mining demand will decrease, refining capacity will not

-EV are ~4x more efficient than ICE due to higher powertrain efficiency, regenerative braking, and optimized platform design
* 4.8x more efficient than passenger car
  4.3x more efficient than light truck/van
  4.2x more efficient than Class 8 truck

-Tesla Model 3 energy consumption is 131MPGe vs Toyota Corolla with 34MPG (3.9x difference)

-Flexible and inflexible energy consumption portion split
	Supercharging/commercial charging and vehicles with <50% SOC are inflexible demand
	Home and workplace AC charging is flexible demand, modeled with 72-hour energy conservation constraint since most drivers can charge at off-peak

-On average, Tesla Drivers charge once every 1.7 days from 60% to 90% SOC

*-Global electrification of transport sector eliminates 28 PWH/year of fossil fuel use and create 7 PWh/year additional electrical demand (4x EV efficiency)

-Heat pumps 3x more efficient than gas furnace

-All global hydrogen production will come from electrolysis (instead of methane pyrolysis)

-Capacity factor of wind higher than solar in the winter

-Optimal generation and storage portfolio results in 32% curtailment

-Higher transmission capacities generally reduce the total generation and storage buildout, but there is an economic tradeoff between building more transmission and building more generation plus storage

-In 2022, 6% of solar generation in California (CAISO) was curtailed due to operational constraints, such as thermal generators’ inability to ramp down below their minimum operating level, or local congestion on the transmission system

-Shoulder months = Spring & Fall. When electricity demand is lower as heating and cooling seasons are over and solar/wind generation is higher
*Potential space for hydrogen

-Standard-range vehicles can utilize the lower energy density chemistries (LFP), whereas long-range vehicles require higher 
energy density chemistries (high nickel, low to zero cobalt Nickel Manganese cathodes)

-642 TWh of Hydrogen storage & 112 TWh of vehicle batteries to meet global electricity demand and transportation batteries

-Materials requiring significant capacity growth:
Mining: Nickel, Lithium, Graphite, Copper
Refining: Nickel, Lithium, Graphite, Cobalt, Copper, Battery grade Iron & Manganese

-Fossil fuel economy would be $14 trillion of world GDP

-6,785 Lithium kilotons required/year

*-Median power density for fixed-tilt systems installed 2011-2019 was 2.8 acres/MWdc, so a global solar panel fleet of 18.3TW would require 71.4 million acres or 0.19% of global land area

*-Global wind turbine fleet of 12.2TW would require 9.2 million acres or 0.02% of total land area

-~60 million circuit miles will need to be added/reconductored globally to achieve fully sustainable/electrified economy (10% high V, 90% low V)

-68Gt o material are extracted from earth every year

*-solar panels will require 13% of the 2023 USGS silver reserves, but silver can be substituted with copper, which is cheaper and more abundant

Solar Inverter Specs

*Fully compliant to IEEE 1547-2018 and IEEE 1547.1-2020 GW.2.0 or SMC shall be used with Solar Inverter
*The following specifications reflect Tesla Solar Inverter with Site Controller (Tesla P/N 1538000-45-y)

-Rapid Shutdown Initiation: Upon initiating Rapid Shutdown, the MCI excitation signal is lost and all MCIs will open within 30 seconds, bringing all voltages across the solar assembly and PV strings to safe levels

-Manual Rapid Shutdown Initiation: Rapid Shutdown can be manually initiated using the Solar Inverter AC breaker, AC disconnect, or the System Shutdown Switch if one is present. The loss of AC grid is detected and RSD is initiated.

-Self-Test Function: Each morning Tesla Solar Inverter performs a safety test to ensure Rapid Shutdown can successfully limit array voltage i.e. rendered high impedance and collapse. Failure of the Rapid Shutdown self-test will initiate an alarm and a faulted state that prevents the solar assembly from operating until service is performed.

-Arc Fault Detection and Protection: Compliant with NEC code section 690.11, UL1699B and UL1998 standards. Arc fault detection is performed to detect series arcs within the PV array.The detection algorithms work based on both voltage and current. When an arc fault is detected, Tesla Solar Inverter stops converting power and disconnects from the grid

-Ground Fault Protection: Tesla Solar Inverter is capable of detecting ground faults in compliance with UL 1741

-Protective Earth Impedance Check: The scheduled time for the PE impedance test is every morning before closing the inverter side AC relays. Upon detected loss of PE or identification of a high impedance value Tesla Solar Inverter does not connect to the grid until the fault is cleared manually or a repeated PE impedance test demonstrates a sufficiently low impedance.

Supercharger Fire Department Pamphlet

-Equipment at site of Supercharger:
Transformer - Steps down voltage from utility feeder to 480V
Switchboard/Disconnect - Means of disconnect for Supercharger and ground fault/overcurrent protection
Supercharger Cabinet - Converts AC to DC, controls current & voltage to vehicles
Supercharger Post - Connects to vehicle and communicates between vehicle and cabinet

-Normally-Off State
With no vehicle charging, only 24V present on Supercharger Post. Vehicle must be connected for comms.

-Isolated DC Output
Each power converter in Cabinet has internal isolation transformer, allowing downstream DC voltage to be floating (+ & - polarities have high-impedance isolation from ground). If one polarity experiences a fault to ground, no grounded equipment will become energized and not touch hazard. If both polarities fault to ground together, internal fuse will open and deenergize. Isolation tests during charging test between DC + and GND or DC - and GND

-Supercharger Operation Safety
After connection, Supercharger performs short-circuit test and isolation test. To minimize inrush current, voltage at connector is matched to vehicles battery pack before contactors close.
