N-1 contingency safe = any single power element going out will not lead to abnormal voltage or loading conditions

Hidden failures (permanent defect causing relay to incorrectly remove circuit elements from a circuit)

Current Lags voltage -> Reactive power Positive
Current Leads voltage -> Reactive power negative
Frequency depends on rpm of primary mover
Injecting reactive power increases voltage
-------------------------------------------------------
For consistency, Category I is paired with Category A, and Categories II and III are paired with Category B
*Most DER should have at least Category B performance especially in high DER penetration areas where DER handle power output variability (solar PV)

Cat I and II DER shall not reduce total apparent current during disturbance in mandatory operation mode <80% of pre-disturbance value.

Cat I,II max ride through disturbances =2 (20s between, 10s between)
Cat III =3 (5s between)

ROCOF ride through Cat I:0.5 Hz/S
ROCOF ride through Cat II:2 Hz/S
ROCOF ride through Cat III:3 Hz/S
*Nadir = Lowest point in frequency before goes up

Ramp up takes 10s for full output


Cat I OV1-OV2: 1.1-1.2 (trip time 2-0.176 s), UV1-UV2: 0.7-0.16(trip time 2-0.16s)


Island Types

Uncategorized: Not designated as an intentional island, only allowed under certain criteria
Intentional island-capable: DER that can disable or modify its islanding detection function
Black Start Capable: DER that can energize EPS that contains no other energy source
Isochronous-capable: DER can independently regulate voltage and frequency to fixed set points

Tests/verifications/evals
-Average annual load & aggregate nameplate capacity decide wither these evals apply at PCC or PoC (sec 4.2)
*Smaller DER testing usually at PoC, Larger usually at PCC

Max DER response time to maintain constant power factor is 10s

Type tests (enough for PoC): Verifies that component or multiple can operate together (if tested component power rating 50-200% of product family, it is representative)
Production tests: Done on every unit of DER and interconnect of equip. prior to customer delivery to verify conformance to standards
Commissioning tests
Periodic Tests
DER Design evaluation (desk study): Eval during interconnection review process to verify conformance to whole system, done off-site
As-Built Eval (on-site): Eval at time of commissioning to verify that system parts meet reqs (no testing)
Basic vs Details DER Evals: Eval on design and build to standards vs engineering verification of chosen components with models and simlulations


RPA = Reference Point of Applicability (usually PCC)
-In Local EPS where zero sequence continuity between PCC and PoC, PoC may be RPA
-If aggregate nameplate capacity <_500 kVA, PoC may be RPA

Applicable voltages are average of three phases (RMS)

If Authorities Having Jurisdiction designate DER for critical ops (hospitals, fires stations), they are exampted from
 
voltage ride through, 
frequency ride through,

Intentional islanding reqs

DER shall inject or absorb reactive power for active power output levels <_min steady state active power or 5% of rated (whichever is greater)
*Some active power may curtail to mee apparent power constraints

Reactive power control functions (constant power factor default mode *sec. 4.13)
-response time to maintain constant power factor 10s>

Voltage-reactive power mode
Active power-reactive power mode
Constant reactive power mode
-------------------------------------------------------------------
ROCOF (rate of chnage of frequency) ride trhough is average of ROCOF over window of at least 0.1s

DER shall limit active power output in <30s to active power limit set point

Where trip during setting are atleast 160ms or 1% of tripping time beyond the ride through duration, DER must follow sec 6.4 before trip

DER capable of delaying enter service by adjustable min delay between 0-600s (300s default)*Enter service period is between 1-1000s (default 300s), active power increase of any single step <_20% of DER active power rating

Sync with Area EPS shall not cause step changes in RMS voltage at PCC exceeding 3% nominal at medium voltage, 5% at low voltage

Freq difference during sync: 0.1-0.3 Hz
Voltage difference: 3-10
Phase angle difference: 10-20
*Larger systems get tight constraint
